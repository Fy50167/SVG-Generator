# SVG Generator

## Description

This application uses the Inquirer package in order to take user input and generate an corresponding SVG file, allowing the user to create their own logos and cut on costs by avoiding having to hire graphic designers for small jobs for any projects that require their own logo.

## Installation

All necessary dependencies (Inquirer and Jest) are already installed so simply downloading all assets from the repository should provide all of the necessary files. The application can then be run by running the command node index.

## Usage

The user provides input to all of the Inquirer prompts, and the SVG is automatically generated based on these. The Jest tests are purely included for informative purposes and are not necessary to run in order to generate the SVGS. For a demo of the application, view the video at the following link: [Demo link](https://www.loom.com/share/efbe36f645084bba9ef7f9aeb50d4888?sid=029a6aa3-1c60-46c5-acec-76c1bd334530)
